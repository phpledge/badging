# Public Health Pledge Badging for Events

To learn more about our project, please check out [Public Health Pledge Event Badging Standard](https://publichealthpledge.com/badging).

Please review the [Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/phpledge/badging/blob/main/guidelines.md) before applying for a badge.

## Current Standard: v2023-01

Our badging standard will change as medical science, epidemiology, and community practices progress. Because the standard will evolve, an eventâ€™s badge is associated with a specific version of the standard indicated by the year and month. Please submit feedback to [phpledge@googlegroups.com](mailto:phpledge@googlegroups.com) or on GitHub.

We are on the first edition of the standard, [v2023-01](https://github.com/phpledge/badging/blob/main/versions/2023-01.md).
